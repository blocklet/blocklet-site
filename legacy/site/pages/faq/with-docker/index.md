## 1. Pull Image

```shell
docker pull arcblock/abtnode
```

## 2. Run

```shell
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443  -v <your host directory>:/data/abtnode arcblock/abtnode
```

The data generated by the node is placed in the /data/abtnode directory in the container, and we recommend trying not to place the data in the container, keep the container stateless.

## 3. Registries

We also provide Docker images in the Github Container Registry and AWS ECR, so you can choose the appropriate Registry for your scenario

Currently our Docker images are published to 3 registries:

- Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/arcblock/abtnode
- Github Package Registry: https://github.com/orgs/ArcBlock/packages/container/package/abtnode
- Amazon ECR: https://gallery.ecr.aws/i0s0w0c9/abtnode
