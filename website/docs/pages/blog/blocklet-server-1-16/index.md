## Backup and migrate apps using DID Spaces

We have brought the DID Spaces for users, which allows users to back up their applications to DID Spaces, and easily migrate applications to another Blocklet Server when needed. It even allows users to directly back up application data to DID Spaces without being aware of the existence of Blocklet Server, and then directly deploy the application to a serverless environment. This improvement will greatly enhance the user's application management and migration experience, making users feel relaxed and happy.

## Application structure upgrade

We have also upgraded the application structure. The new application structure improves the composability, stability and performance of the application, creating a more flexible application combination experience for you. You can now modify the mount point of any component, delete any component, easily achieve personalized needs, and create more freedom.
