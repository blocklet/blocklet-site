## Application DID management integration to DID Wallet

Our latest upgrade integrates DID management of applications into [DID Wallet](https://www.didwallet.io/), allowing users to manage their own applications and on-chain assets more easily and securely.

## Backup and migrate apps using DID Spaces

We have brought the [DID Spaces](https://www.didspaces.com/) for users, which allows users to back up their applications to [DID Spaces](https://www.didspaces.com/), and easily migrate applications to another Blocklet Server when needed. It even allows users to directly back up application data to [DID Spaces](https://www.didspaces.com/) without being aware of the existence of Blocklet Server, and then directly deploy the application to a serverless environment. This improvement will greatly enhance the user's application management and migration experience, making users feel relaxed and happy.

## Application structure upgrade

We have also upgraded the application structure. The new application structure improves the composability, stability and performance of the application, creating a more flexible application combination experience for you. You can now modify the mount point of any component, delete any component, easily achieve personalized needs, and create more freedom.
