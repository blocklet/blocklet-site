## Why Node.js?

To run any code samples in this documentation, you need to have Node.js and npm installed first. To see if you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Install Node.js

Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system so you can test your applications on multiple versions of npm to ensure they work for users on different versions.
