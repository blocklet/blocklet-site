## Why do I need a DID Wallet?

DID Wallet is a decentralized wallet that can be used to manage not only digital assets (Token, NFT, etc.) but also decentralized identity (DID for short).

If you are a developer who is ready to make a splash in the Blocklet world, then DID Wallet is an essential tool to have on hand. In the Blocklet world, from having a Blocklet Server to starting a new Blocklet development debugging, every step requires the participation of DID Wallet.

When starting a Blocklet Server, you need to use the DID Wallet to participate in the initialization process of the new Blocklet Server, and will save a Blocklet Server owner credentials in your DID Wallet.

When developing a Blocklet, you need to use the DID Wallet to participate in the Blocklet development process, including logging into a Blocklet that requires authorization, debugging various DID Connect requests during Blocklet development, and so on.

In addition, in the Blocklet world, everything corresponds to a unique DID, e.g.

- A Blocklet waiting to be installed in the Store
- A Blocklet Server that is up and running
- A Blocklet instance running inside the Blocklet Server
- A pass to control various access rights
- ...

In daily development, you need a tool to help you manage these DIDs easily, DID Wallet is such a tailor-made tool.
