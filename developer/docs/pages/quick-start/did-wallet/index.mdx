## Why do I need DID Wallet?

[DID Wallet](https://didwallet.io) is an decentralized app that's used to manage digital assets(such as [token](https://chain.abtnet.io/docs/en/conceptual/tokens) and [NFT](https://chain.abtnet.io/docs/en/conceptual/nfts)) and [decentralized identities](https://chain.abtnet.io/docs/en/conceptual/did).

DID Wallet is required in the blocklet development workflow to accomplish the following tasks:

- Manage your decentralized identities when talking with blocklets
- Receive and present blocklet server passport
- Receive and present blocklet owner passport
- Receive and spend blockchain tokens, NFTs
- Authorize other dangerous operations for blocklet and server
